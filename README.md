*This project is a fork of the [XAML Styler for Visual Studio 2010](http://xamlstyler.codeplex.com)*

### About

**XAML Styler** is a visual studio 2012 extension, which makes XAML markup source code beautify much easier by 
sorting the attributes based on their importance, and aligning them under eachother.

This tool can help you/your team maintain a better XAML coding style as well as a much better XAML readability.
